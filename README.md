# Linux-bash-program
A repository showcasing small bash program developed by me.

## Program 1
This Bash program is designed to create a text file with student answers for multiple-choice questions. 
The program requires a minimum of two arguments - the name of the text file to be created and a series of integers representing the answers to the multiple-choice questions.

This program requires Bash to run. It should work on most Unix-based systems.

To use this program, run the script with the following arguments:
```
./program.sh [filename] [answer1] [answer2] [answer3] ...
```

The program will create a new text file with the provided filename and append the student's ID number and answers to the file. 
The answers should be provided as integers from 1-5 or "-" to represent a skipped question.
